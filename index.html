      <p>You,
        Yes You!
        Stand still laddie!

        When grow up, went to school,
        There were certrain teachers who
        Would hurt children anyway they could.
        By pouring their derision,
        Upon anything we did,
        Exposing any weaknees,
        However carefully hidden by the kids.
