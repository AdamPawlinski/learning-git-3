      <p>You,
        Yes You!
        Stand still laddie!

        When grow up, went to school,
        There were certrain teachers who
        Would hurt children anyway they could.
        By pouring their derision,
        Upon anything we did,
        Exposing any weaknees,
        However carefully hidden by the kids.
      </p>
	<p>But in the town it was well known,
	That when they got home at night,
	Their fat and psychopatic wives.
	Would trash them within inches of their live!

	We don't need no education
	We don't need no thought control
	No dark sarcasm in the classroom
	Teachers leave them kids alone
	Hey!
	Teacher, leave them kids alone!
	All in all it's just another brick in the wall
	All in all you're just another brick in the wall
	</p>
